This project is a backend for a video-sharing platform, inspired by YouTube, built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Cloudinary. Itâ€™s my first time working on a backend project, and it was both challenging and exciting. 
The platform allows users to upload and watch videos, while features like video view tracking, secure user authentication with JWT, and password hashing with bcrypt are implemented. 
Cloudinary is used to store videos and thumbnails, while MongoDB manages user data, videos, and comments. I focused on making the backend secure, fast, and efficient. 
Developing this project required a lot of time and effort, and it helped me learn essential backend development skills, including security practices, database management, and API design.
